# Directus 9 extensions sample

Exploring how Directus extensions work.

```sh
# After cloning this repo
git clone https://github.com/directus/directus.git .directus
yarn
yarn build
docker-compose up
```

- Don't modify the `extensions` directory as it is auto-generated by `yarn build`
- Don't forget to use the same Directus version as the one used in docker-compose, and to keep it up to date
